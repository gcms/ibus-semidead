This is a simple ibus engine that provides a US international keyboard with
what I have called "semi dead" keys. Apostrophes and quotes work as dead keys
if followed by a vowel (e.g., ' followed by a becomes á) or other accented
consonants in latin languages (e.g., ' followed by c becomes ç and ~ followed
by n becomes ñ). If they are followed by other consonants the symbol is just
printed (e.g., ' followed by t becomes 't). This is the behavior that is
usually found in OS X and Windows.

Probably implementing an ibus engine is not the appropriate way to do this, but
it was the quickest solution I could find due to the lack of information.


The implementation is based on the https://github.com/phuang/ibus-tmpl project.

To install it you need to install the developer libraries for ibus. It was
only tested in my system (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS + Gnome).

./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
sudo make install


It is necessary to set ibus as the input method. You can do this by setting the
environment variables

GTK_IM_MODULE=ibus
QT_IM_MODULE=ibus
XMODIFIERS=@im=ibus


You may need to restart the ibus-daemon and add the new input method using
ibus-setup

After restarting the graphical interface, you should find the keyboard
US, international semi dead in the system input sources list.
